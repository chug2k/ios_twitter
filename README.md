### Simple iOS Twitter client

This is a simple iOS Twitter client that is meant as a demonstration for architecting a RESTful API client.

It has a few nifty features, like replying, favoriting, and retweeting. Yes, all that and more in one amazing client. It uses `NSNotificationCenter` to synchronize data between views. There's a lot of code repetition, unfortunately, as I have much to learn about two things:
* getters and setters 
* composable views

I found myself repeating logic between the Tweet Details view and the tweet cell itself. 

Perhaps the most amazing thing about the code is how most if was written between the hours of 11pm and 3 am. I think it took about four and a half of these sessions, meaning this took me about fifteen hours.

Stay tuned for some amazing screenshots to be added to this README.
